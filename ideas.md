- some urls are still cannot be parsed, where special characters like `[` are not escaped
- use soundness for organizing console and tab completions
- make runtime executable(maybe also soundness)
- handle process exit - save state when it happens
    - also save config
- check resources size, and if the one that you need to download and local sizes are the same - just skip
- url blacklist logic
  - on bad url interrupt and ask user if he wants to blacklist it
  - as a part of initial config
  - based on file size
- use soundness for url parsing/comparing/requests
- logic, where processing urls queue happening in main thread, but fetching and parsing you can do in a separate thread
    - main thread process url
    - if prepared documents queue < 5, run 5 threads to fetch and parse 5 more documents from url queue
